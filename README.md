# Maze-Generator

Implemented a maze generator and maze solver using recursive depth first search algorithm.

The algorithm creates a "perfect maze", where a maze is a 2-dimensional matrix of square cells and a perfect maze is a maze in which any 2 cells are connected by a single unique path. This also garantees a unique solution.

The perfect maze is generated by using a recursive algoritm to dig paths. Starting with a maze where a wall exists on every side of every cell, the algorithm continues to remove walls until a perfect maze has been constructed. The algorithm is implemented by starting at any cell, mark the cell as "visited", randomly choose an unvisited adjacent cell and remove the wall inbetween, then recursively call this algorithm to choose the next cell to visit.

A solution is found by using a recursive depth first search algorithm with backtracking. The algorithm recursively investigates all possibilities by moving down a path in the maze, and if that path fails, then it backs up to the nearest place where an alternative path that hasn't been visited is available until we find a path that leads to the end of the maze.
